## 🎯 Key Features

- **Predictive Analytics**: Forecasts OOM events 30-60 minutes in advance using time-series analysis
- **Proactive Scaling**: HPA integration that scales before failure, not after
- **Zero-Trust Security**: OIDC-based CI/CD with AWS STS, no long-lived credentials
- **GitOps Workflow**: Infrastructure changes via Git commits, automated deployments
- **Production Observability**: Custom metrics, dashboards, and alerting

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Infrastructure Layer
- **EKS Cluster**: Kubernetes 1.29 with 2 t3.medium worker nodes across 3 AZs
- **VPC Design**: Public/private subnet architecture with NAT gateway
- **State Management**: S3 backend with DynamoDB locking for concurrent safety

### Application Layer
- **Memory Leak Simulator**: Python Flask app with intentional memory growth
- **Custom Metrics**: Prometheus client exposing `app_memory_bytes`, `app_memory_objects`
- **Health Checks**: Liveness and readiness probes for reliability

### Monitoring Stack
- **Prometheus**: 15-second scrape interval for real-time data
- **Grafana**: 5-panel dashboard with predictive gauges
- **AlertManager**: (Ready for) routing to Slack/PagerDuty

### Predictive Engine
- **Algorithm**: Linear regression over 30-minute window with 1-hour forecast
- **Trigger Point**: Alerts when prediction exceeds 450 MiB (90% of limit)
- **Action**: Can trigger HPA scaling or preemptive pod restart

**Dashboard Panels:**
1. Memory Usage (Bytes) - Real-time consumption
2. Leaked Objects Count - Number of objects in memory
3. Predicted Memory in 1 Hour - Gauge turns red when approaching limit
4. Memory Growth Rate - Bytes per second increase
5. Request Rate by Endpoint - Traffic analysis
